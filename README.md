    Set the VM Name:

        Name: Born2beRoot

    Base Memory: 1024 MB

    Processors: 1 CPU

    EFI: Ignore the "Enable EFI" checkbox

1.3 Hard Disk Setup

    Select Create a Virtual Hard Disk Now and choose:

        Disk Size: 8.00 GB

    File Type: VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)

    Storage: Dynamically allocated

2. Debian Installation Steps
2.1 Begin Installation

    Start the VM and select Install from the Debian installer menu (Do not select "Graphical install").

    Language: English

    Location: Choose your location (e.g., Portugal or your respective country).

    Configure the keyboard: Choose "American English".

    Configure the network:

        Hostname: <your_intra_username>42 (e.g., user42)

        Leave the domain name blank.

2.2 Users and Passwords

    Root password: Follow password policy (must contain uppercase, lowercase, and be at least 10 characters long). Example: FUCKDEBIAN1234

    User setup:

        Full name: <your_intra_username>

        Username: <your_intra_username>

        User password: Same as root password.

3. Partitioning and Configuration
3.1 Partition the Disks

    Partition setup:

        Select Manual.

        Select SCSI3 (0,0,0) (sda), then create a new empty partition table.

    First Partition:

        Size: 500M, Type: Primary, Location: Beginning.

        Mount point: /boot.

    Second Partition:

        Size: Max available space, Type: Logical.

        Mount point: /.

3.2 Set Up Encryption and LVM

    Encryption setup:

        Select Configure encrypted volumes.

        Make sure to select /dev/sda5 for encryption (keep /dev/sda1 deselected).

        Use the same passphrase as the root password for encryption.

    Logical Volume Manager (LVM):

        Create a volume group named LVMGroup with /dev/mapper/sda5_crypt.

        Create logical volumes for root, swap, home, var, srv, tmp, and var-log.

4. Final Steps
4.1 Configure Package Manager

    Scan installation media: No

    Mirror country: Choose your country (e.g., Australia)

    HTTP proxy: Leave blank.

4.2 Software Selection

    Ensure no software is selected for installation.

4.3 GRUB Installation

    Install GRUB: Yes

    Device: /dev/sda (the primary boot disk)

4.4 Finish Installation

    After GRUB is installed, finish the installation.

    Reboot the system, and the installation will be complete.

Conclusion

Once the installation is complete, you will have a fully functional Debian system running on your Virtual Machine, complete with encrypted partitions and LVM configuration.
